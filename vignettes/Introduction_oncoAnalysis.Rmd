## Introduction

The goal of `oncoAnalysis` package is to develop functions that check if there is mutations between healthy input DNA FASTA file and mutated(suspected) DNA FASTA file. The package contains the main components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory, R subdirectory(where functions are storing), LICENSE, README, folder vignettes, tests, data and inst. The package is build for BCB410H (Applied Bioinformatics) course work. The package is currently under construction and the current version contains two analysis functions and two plotting functions. **This document is a brief description of oncoAnalysis (version 0.1.0)**. It was written in R Markdown, using the [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) package for production. View `help(package = "oncoAnalysis")` for more details. 

To obtain the **oncoAnalysis** package, use the following commands:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xuxiny17/oncoAnalysis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("oncoAnalysis")
```

To glance all sample functions currently available in the package:
``` r
ls("package:oncoAnalysis")
```

To glance all sample data sets currently available in the package:
``` r
data(package = "oncoAnalysis")
```

## Read in FASTA Files

We want to first read in the DNA sequence we want, the user could use the `read.fasta` function offered by package *seqinr* package for FASTA file reading or use the `fastaReader()` function offered by *oncoAnalysis* package. 
```{r file input, message=FALSE}
# library("seqinr") # Load the required R package

# Obtain the path of the sample FASTA files 
inputhea <- system.file("extdata", "sample.fasta", package = "oncoAnalysis")
inputmut <- system.file("extdata", "samplemut.fasta", package = "oncoAnalysis")

# Read using read.fasta() from seqinr R package
sampleseq <- seqinr::read.fasta(file = inputhea)
samplemutseq <- seqinr::read.fasta(file = inputmut)

# Process and store data
sampleseq1 <- sampleseq$Sample[1:(length(sampleseq$Sample))]
samplemutseq1 <- samplemutseq$Samplemut[1:(length(samplemutseq$Samplemut))]
```

## Obtain Mutation Details

### `fastaReader()`
The `fastaReader()` function takes in the file name of a FATSA file, and return the Base characters contained in the input FATSA file (If the input is a valid DNA sequence (only contains ATCGatcg), otherwise it would print an error message). 
```{r fastaReader insertion, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Read using fastaReader()
inputins <- system.file("extdata", "sampleIns.fasta", package = "oncoAnalysis")
sampleinsseq <- oncoAnalysis:::fastaReader(inputins)
sampleinsseq
```

```{r fastaReader deletion, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
inputdel <- system.file("extdata", "sampleDel.fasta", package = "oncoAnalysis")
sampledelseq <- oncoAnalysis:::fastaReader(inputdel)
sampledelseq
```

### `mutChecker()`
The package allows obtaining the mutation details by comparing the two DNA sequences (same length) we have just read in.
The `mutChecker()` function is used for the previous purpose. The function takes in two DNA sequence (In character vectors form), the first is healthy version and the second is the suspected mutation one. 
```{r mutChecker , message=FALSE}
# We obtain the details using mutChecker() function. 
mutCheckerResults <- mutChecker(sampleseq1, samplemutseq1)
mutCheckerResults
```

The results contains: 1. The total number of mutations. 2. the Base A, T, C, G mutated respectively, the positions of the mutations in the sequence, and the mutation matrix containing mutation details, where column names represent the base in original sequence, Role names represent the base in mutated sequence. Used to check for example how many base A has mutated into base T.

If the two input sequence has different length, it would print in the console telling the user if there is a deletion or insertion happened. Illustrated as following.

```{r mutChecker deletion, message=FALSE}
# The two sequences have different length
mutChecker(sampleseq1, sampledelseq)
```

```{r mutChecker insertion, message=FALSE}
# The two sequences have different length
mutChecker(sampleseq1, sampleinsseq)
```


### `mutTable()`
The `mutTable()` function takes in the Matrix generated by `mutChecker()` function and outputs a summery table.
```{r mutTable , message=FALSE}
# We print the table by summarizing the Matrix we have generated in the previous
# Section.
muttable <- mutTable(mutCheckerResults$MutMatrix)
muttable
```

The table generated contains mutation details. (Column names represent the base in original sequence, Role names represent the base in mutated sequence. Used to check for example how many base A has mutated into base T.)

## Plot of Mutation Details

### `mutPlot()`
There are two plotting functions available, the `mutPlot()` function takes in the mutation details generated by `mutChecker()` function, and displays the number of mutations occuring along with the number of each base mutated. It could also take in optinal arguments: barcolor, title_name, x_name, y_name which allow some extent of customize. 
```{r mutPlot , message=FALSE}
# Plot the number of mutations
mutPlot(mutvals = mutCheckerResults)
```
The plot illustrates the number of base mutated (Base A, C, G, T, and Total respectively). 

### `mutCompPlot`
The `mutCompPlot()` function visulize the number of bases in healthy and mutated sequence respectively, this gives a clearer view on how the two sequences differ. The function takes in two DNA sequence, the first is healthy version and the second is the suspected mutation one. It could also take in optional arguments title_name, x_name, y_name which allows customization. 
```{r mutCompPlot , message=FALSE}
# Plot the mutation Comparison Plot using mutCompPlot()
mutCompPlot(sampleseq1, samplemutseq1)
```
