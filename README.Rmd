devtools::install_github("xuxiny17/oncoAnalysis")
```

## Overview


## Contributions
<br>
<br>
The author of the package is Xu Xinyi. The *mutChecker* function takes in DNA sequence and generate detailed mutaion information. The code for *mutChecker* function uses the loop creating and vector comparing ideas illustrated online (See *References* section for detiled documentation). The code for *mutTable* function uses the table creating idea illustrated online to create a two way table.(See *References* section for detiled documentation). The *mutPlot* and *mutCompPlot* function make use of the `ggplot2` R package, and the plotting details imitated the tutorials online along with the technique of adding optional arguments to the functions (See *References* section for detiled documentation).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(oncoAnalysis)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
